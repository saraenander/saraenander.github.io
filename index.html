								<h3 style="text-align:left;"><b>R&D Internship at Ericsson</b></h3>
										<p style="text-align:left;"> I have been working part time during the spring and fall in 2021, as well as full time during the summer. My tasks have mostly been
											preprocessing data and training artificial neural networks for object detection. I planned and structured my own project for the summer and finished by presenting the
											results to the department. Now I work 20% with preprocessing data and incorporating it into the framwork being used.

									<h3 style="text-align:middle;"><b>AI connect four</b></h3>
											<p style="text-align:left;"> As a part of a course in Artificial Intelligence an AI that would always win against a server was set up. Minimax search was used in combination with alpha-beta pruning
												where each move was evaluated on a new branch in a decision tree, and if it was clear that the branch did not contribute to a better final score it was pruned in order to reduce computational time and cost.
												The heuristic node evaluation was made by implementing a scoring system that gave the highest score for 4 in a row, a lower score for 3 in a row, and even lower for 2 in a row. The same was implemented for the moves
												of the opponent, but giving negative scores. The minimax implementation was done recursively.

									<h3 style="text-align:left;"><b>OCR-project</b></h3>
										<p style="text-align:left;"> As part of a course in Image Analysis we built and tested a small system for optical character recognition in Matlab. The inputs
											were different images of handwritten numbers, and our task was to segment the images to individual numbers, find good features to separate the numbers
											and finally to correctly classify the numbers. The assignment was to achieve an accuracy higher than 60% for the easier images, and higher than 50% for the more
											complicated images.

Expansion of the material due to the temperature increase and the stress caused by the expansion was also investigated. These calculations were done using MATLAB.  </p>

								<h2>About me</h2>
								</header>
								<span class="image leftleft"><img src="images/aboutme.jpeg" width=40% alt=""/></span>
									<p style="text-align:left;">I am currently studying my fourth year of Engineering physics at Lund University. I have chosen to specialise in Machine Learning, but I am interested
								in exploring other fields connected to it as well. The reason I chose to study Engineering and later Machine Learning is that I am very curious and
								love to discover how the world works. I am fascinated by how technology affects the everyday life, and its capability to improve the lives of so many.
								In my professional life I would love to be part in developing technology that somehow makes a difference in improving people's lives.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								As a person I am adventurous and I love to spend time outdoors, doing activities like trail running, hiking or surfing. I also enjoy long dinners with my friends,
								reading good books and to grow vegetables on my balcony.</p>
